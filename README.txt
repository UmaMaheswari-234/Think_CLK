# Battery Impedance Analysis

This analysis visualizes how the electrolyte resistance (Re) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) change with cycle count during the charge/discharge cycles of a Li-ion battery. These parameters help in understanding how the battery ages over time.

## Observations:
- The electrolyte resistance (Re) increases gradually with the cycle count, indicating the aging of the electrolyte.
- The charge transfer resistance (Rct) also shows an upward trend, which is indicative of the battery's internal resistance increasing with usage.
- These changes can impact the battery's overall performance and lifespan.
